## Assignment 1
### Task
Implement a program using a custom Linked List to read a number of coordinate points from a text file and interpret them as Polygons. The program should have functionality to calculate the area of these polygons, as well as the distance to the origin (0, 0) of the closest point of each Polygon. Using the area (And the origin distance if the area was not significantly different), the Polygons should then be sorted using an insertion sort, and both the unsorted and sorted lists should be outputted using a specified format.
### Compile
